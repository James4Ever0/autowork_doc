We have found some ways to automate the entire process of video production.
The script.
Adobe scripts, DAW scripts, and the universal one -> UI automation, even system level modification.
All about the stuff that we have learned so far.

Just jump right in, feel the shit inside.
There is no way that we can do it without the proof.
Human throws shit on us, so we have to throw it back.
End of talk.
